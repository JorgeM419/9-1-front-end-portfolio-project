## Jorge Moran

i will create an application using the yu-gi-oh API for data.

### User Stories

The api i decided to use it a Yu-gi-oh one, basically users will be able to search for a specific card and retrieve the cards entire information from the sets it was printed on to the price as well as the rarity. they'll also be able to search sets as well, for example if they wanted to see all the cards printed from a certain booster set all they would need to do is search the name of said set and every card printed.
